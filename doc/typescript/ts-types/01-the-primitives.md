# The Primitives

- In JS
  - `string`, `number`, `bigint`, `boolean`, `null`, `symbol`, `undefined`
- TS extends this list with a few more.
  - `any` - allow anything
  - `unknown` - ensure someone using this type declares what the type is
  - `never` - itâ€™s not possible that this type could happen
  - `void` - a function which returns `undefined` or has no return value
- To learn the type of a variable, use `typeof`
