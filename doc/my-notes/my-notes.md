# My Notes

- Date() in JavaScript returns a string, On the other hand, constructing a Date with `new Date()` actually gives us a Date object

- Forgetting to handle `null` and `undefined` is the cause of countless bugs in the world - some consider it a [billion dollar mistake!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybrQvs4x0Ps)
